# Paper reference explorer

I want to input a reference to a particular paper and then get all the references in an easy to explore way, crucially by easily selecting what papers I think are interesting instead of just all the papers referenced like most tools which is overwhelming.

Should be able to answer questions like:
* What references have the most overlapping citations?
* Which have the most common authors?
* Which are the most common publishing venues?
* What papers have the most similar references?

For now I just see three levels as helpful: original paper, that paper's references, the set of papers referenced by the relevant references of the first paper.

It would be good to account for difference citation styles so that it's easy to check boxes as you read.

I/O in jupyter is misery.
